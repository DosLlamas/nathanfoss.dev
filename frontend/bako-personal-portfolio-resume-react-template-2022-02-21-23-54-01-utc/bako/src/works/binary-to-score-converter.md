### Binary to Score Converter

#### Overview

Soon after graduating from Flatiron School's software engineering bootcamp, I had a coding interview with the Principal Software Engineer @ Microsoft Paul Dakessian. Microsoft! FAANG! Exciting! But...I honestly failed miserably lol. However, he kindly gave me advice on where to improve and gave me this project assignment to cement the concept I missed in the interview. I took his advice and this project was the result that I ended up sending back to him for approval.


Here were his notes on my responses during the interview that I ended up using to improve my interview skills:

-Don’t assume what they are going to ask and then start

Tell me about yourself: 

-Pharmacy, don’t start with that -Lots of I’m trying to do x Trying to become a developer

Languages:

React, Ruby on Rails

-Looking for front end role, short answers. Sounds disengaged/uninterested

Why you looking for new role? Doing part time internship, wants to find a full time role

What perfect role for you next?

Array/Linked/Hashmaps difference Linkedlist less space Array, not traverse Hashmap - object ^^There's more differences

Stacks/Queues No

Enum/Struct No

Front end focused

Noisy background

Coding:

-No indents
-Didn’t ask questions, just started coding

-Didn’t write out steps talk through, or validate

-Very inefficient, multi loops to break, Can use split

-Good to talk through code

-Oof the section1/2 split

-Counts section isn’t going to work

-Doubling

Questions at end: -Asked all three at once?

Extra tips: "There are only two outcomes to an interview:

What I learned from his advice:

You learn from your mistakes so you can do better on the next interview. Therefore don't stress about the interview.
"Don't focus on solving the problem fast or slow, rather focus on solving the problem."
